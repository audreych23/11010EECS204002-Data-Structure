Implementation of Data Structure final project

A bike rental system:  which uses the concept of data stuctures and object-oriented programming (OOP) that
1. allocates bike for each stations and store them
2. simulates people borrowing bikes until the system closes and has options to reject when empty
and accept when bike is available
3. calculates total revenues for the day 

The program is also optimized with new options that can furthermore increase the revenue.
